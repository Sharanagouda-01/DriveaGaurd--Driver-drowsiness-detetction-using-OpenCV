"Drivegaurd"-Driver Drowsiness Detection System

Overview

This project is a Driver Drowsiness Detection System that monitors a driver's eyes in real-time through a webcam and alerts the driver if drowsiness is detected. The system uses OpenCV for video processing, Keras for classifying eye states (open or closed), and a custom-trained deep learning model for the classification task.

Features

Real-time face and eye detection using OpenCV.
Eye state classification (open/closed) using a trained Keras model.
Drowsiness detection based on prolonged eye closure.
Alerts the driver when drowsiness is detected.

Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/driver-drowsiness-detection.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd driver-drowsiness-detection

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Install the required dependencies:

Usage

Run the drowsiness_detection.py file:

python drowsiness_detection.py

The system will activate the webcam and begin monitoring. If the driverâ€™s eyes remain closed for too long, the system will raise an alert.

Dependencies

The project requires the following libraries:

Python 3.x
OpenCV: For real-time video capture and face/eye detection.
Keras: For loading and using the pre-trained deep learning model.
TensorFlow: Backend for Keras.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
dlib: For landmark detection (optional).
imutils: For easier image processing functions.

Model Training

The Keras model was trained on a dataset of eye images labeled as either open or closed. If you want to train the model yourself:
Gather or use an existing dataset of labeled images (open/closed eyes).

Use the provided train_model.py script to train the model:

python train_model.py
The model will be saved in the model/ directory as eye_state_model.h5.

Future Improvements
Implement head pose estimation to enhance detection accuracy.
Add yawning detection for a more comprehensive drowsiness assessment.
Optimize the model for mobile and edge devices.
